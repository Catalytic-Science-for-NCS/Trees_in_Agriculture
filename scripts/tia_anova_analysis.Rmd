# This is  R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r setup, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#include = TRUE (also this is the default) means in the knitted document, this code chunk will be printed
#warning=FALSE mutes warnings, which once confirmed not to be problems are just eyesores
#message=FALSE mutes messages, which once confirmed not to be problems are just eyesores
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(tidyverse) #This is a package - code that has lovely functions i want to use in this file
require(knitr) #This package has a table function that I like; makes nice tables in final doc
require(RColorBrewer) #This package has great color vectors that are fab for discrete or continous datasets when making graphs
```

## Formatting Tips

**P.S. THis is bold print**  
_P.P.S. This is italics_  
  
You have to add two spaces at the end of the line, and then hit enter  
Otherwise a new line will not be created  
  
See:  
I want to add a new line HERE
but i forgot to add the two spaces after HERE

# Import dataset

## Examine the ```anovaData11.csv``` file

```{r import anovaData11,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#the <- operator stores data in a variable. below, data11 is the variable, and everthing to the right on that line is the data. you can see data11 appear in the environment, usually in the upperright of RStudio, once you run this code
data11<-read_delim("anovaData11.csv",delim=",",col_names=T)

#glimpse gives a cute lil look at your variable
glimpse(data11)
```

## Make data look nice because it could be neater

```{r data cuteness}
# %>% is a "pipe operator", from the tidyverse package. it says "pass the result of the function to the left of the operator on, and use it as the input for the function to the right of the pipe operator
data11<-data11 %>% 
  transmute(
    id=ID,
    anova=ANOVA,
    continent=`CONTINENT: Please select the continent you will address in this questionnaire.  Please select only one.  We welcome responses for multiple continents; however; as responses will likely vary by bio...`,
    avgHeight=`TreeAvgMatureHeight(M)R2`,
    avgWidth=`TreeAvgMatureWidth(M)R2`,
    treeArea=`Tree Area (m2)RecalculatedR2`,
    crop=Crop,
    biome=Biome,
    climate=Clim,
    vegetation=Veg,
    percentCover_optimalWithMech=`CS_Final1OptimalCropSpecificTotal TreeCover/ha (%) w/ Mechanization scaled across all cropland by level of mech(CY)GivenR2`,
    treesPerHec_optimalOverall=`Tha_2FinalOptimalAcrossAll CropsTrees/ha_GivenR2`,
    percentCover_optimalOverall=`AA_3FinalOptimalAcrossAllCrops%cover_GivenR2`  
  )

#to make it cute, i used camel case (with a bit of snake case) and shortened the names
#transmute() tidyverse function  will only keep the columns I list, whereas mutate() tidyverse function would keep all of them. by using transmute i automatically delete the empty columns at the end
#i could also use transmute and mutate to modify the data type and do other funky things to the data, but in this case I'm just using it to rename the columns

glimpse(data11)
View(data11) #View() - note capital V - opens variable in a new tab. nice for scrolling.
```


## Set the data types for each variable
```{r set data classes}

```

## Print the ```unique``` values in each column, and/or get a ```glimpse``` of the data
